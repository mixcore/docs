2. Click the 'Post' tab.
3. Hover the 'Create Post' sub-tab.
4. Start filling in the blanks: enter your post title in the upper field, and enter your post body content in the main post editing box below it.
   5. As needed, input/select/fill-in general, SEO, parents, media, related,... and make other selections from the sections below the post. (Each of these sections is explained below.)
6. When you are ready, select **Published** button then press **Save** button from action navigation.

## Descriptions of Post Fields

### Title/Headline Box
The title of your post. You can use any phrases, words or characters. Avoid using the same title twice as that will cause problems. You can use commas, apostrophes, quotes, hyphens/dashes and other typical symbols in the post like "My Site - Here's Lookin' at You, Kid". mixcore CMS will then clean it up to generate a user-friendly and URL-valid name of the post (also called the "post slug") to compose the permalink for the post.

### Excerpt 
A summary or brief teaser of your post featured on the front page of your site as well as on the category, archives, and search non-single post pages. Note that the Excerpt does not usually appear by default. It only appears in your post if you have modified the template file listing the post to use `model.excerpt` instead of `model.content` to display the Excerpt instead of the full content of a post. 

### Body Copy Box
The blank box where you enter your writing, links, links to images, and any information you want to display on your site. You can use either the Visual or the Text view to compose your post.
