## Now What?

You’ve just completed the 5 Minute Installation of mixcore CMS or one-click install from your web host. Now what?

Let’s take a step-by-step tour through your mixcore CMS site and see how the different functions work and how to make your new site your own. During the first part of this tutorial, please don’t change anything within the program unless it is part of the tutorial. After following these steps, you’ll soon be changing everything.

## Log In

Begin by logging into the “administration area” or the back end of your website. Visit your site’s login page by placing “backend” after your domain name (e.g. http://example.com/backend/login). Now log into mixcore CMS using your admin username and password that you have created above.

## Start at the Top

After logging in you are on the main Administration Screen called the Dashboard. This is the brain behind your website, the place where you can let your creativity explode, writing brilliant prose and designing the best and most lovely website possible. This is where the organization of your site begins – and this is just the start.
