Mixcore modules are PHP scripts that extend the functionality of Mixcore. They enhance the features of Mixcore, or add entirely new features to your site. modules are often developed by volunteers, and are usually free to the public.

modules are available via the Mixcore Plugin Directory. Although modules you find here are thoroughly tested and considered safe to use, they are of varying quality and are often works in progress.
