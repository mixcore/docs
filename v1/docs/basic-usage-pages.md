In Mixcore CMS, you can put content on your site as either a “post” or a “page”. When you’re writing a regular blog entry, you write a post. Posts, in a default setup, appear in reverse chronological order on your blog’s home page.

In contrast, pages are for non-chronological content: pages like “About” or “Contact” would be common examples. Pages live outside of the normal blog chronology, and are often used to present timeless information about yourself or your site — information that is always relevant. You can use Pages to organize and manage the structure of your website content.

In addition to the common “About” and “Contact” pages, other examples include “Copyright”, “Disclosure”, “Legal Information”, “Reprint Permissions”, “Company Information” or “Accessibility Statement”.

In general, pages are very similar to posts in that they both have titles and content. Mixcore CMS Theme template files maintain a consistent look throughout your site. Pages, though, have several key distinctions that make them different from posts.
