### Default Theme: 

> [Shards UI Kit](https://designrevision.com/demo/shards/) Shards is a modern design system based on Bootstrap 4 that comes packed with **10 extra custom components** and **two pre-built landing pages**. It’s also lightweight with its stylesheet weighting only **~13kb minified and gzipped**.

### Admin Portal

> Mixcore CMS Back-office is built on top of the much awaited Bootstrap 4. This makes starting a new project very simple. It also provides benefits if you are already working on a Bootstrap 4 project.
