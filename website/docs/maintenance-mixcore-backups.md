Your Mixcore database contains every post, every comment and every link you have on your blog. If your database gets erased or corrupted, you stand to lose everything you have written. There are many reasons why this could happen, and not all are things you can control. With a proper backup of your Mixcore database and files, you can quickly restore things back to normal.

Instructions to back up your Mixcore site include:

1. Mixcore Site and your Mixcore Database
1. Automatic Mixcore backup options (TBC v2.0.0)
