What is a Theme? # What is a Theme?
Fundamentally, the Mixcore Theme system is a way to “skin” your Mixcore site. Yet, it is more than just a “skin”. Skinning your site implies that only the design is changed. Mixcore Themes can provide much more control over the visual presentation of your content and other data on your Mixcore site, as well as behavior of certain site’s elements while interacting with visitors.

A Mixcore Theme is a collection of files that work together to produce a graphical interface with an underlying unifying design for a website. These files are called template files. A Theme modifies the way the site is displayed, without modifying the underlying software. Themes may include customized template files, image files (*.jpg, *.png, .gif), style sheets (.css), custom Pages, as well as any necessary code files (*.cs, cshtml). For an introduction to template files, see Template Files.
